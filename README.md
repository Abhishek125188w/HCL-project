Online Shopping Of Artwork
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a web-based shopping system for an existing shop. The project objective is to deliver the online shopping application into website platform. This project is an attempt to provide the advantages of online shopping to customers of a real shop. It helps buying the products in the shop anywhere through internet by using a browser. The main objective of this application is to make it interactive and its ease of use. It would make searching, viewing and selection of a product easier.

Here I have used applications:

1.PHP and MySql from database and database connectivity.
2.HTML,CSS and JavaScript for creating the User Interface.
